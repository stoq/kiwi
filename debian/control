Description: a graphical framework to construct simple UI
 Kiwi is a framework and a set of enhanced PyGTK widgets designed to
 make building programs with graphical interfaces both easy to write
 and easy to maintain.
 .
 Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for PyGTK that were
 developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Fully
 object-oriented, and roughly Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi provides a simple,
 practical way to build forms, windows and widgets that transparently
 access and display your object data.
 .
 Kiwi is inspired by Allen Holub's Visual Proxy.
