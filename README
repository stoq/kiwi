Kiwi: A Framework for developing graphical applications in Python.

Kiwi is a framework composed of a set of modules, which eases Python
development using PyGTK. Kiwi makes graphical applications *much* faster
to code, with good architecture and more Python-like bindings; it also
offers extended widgets based upon the original PyGTK widgets.

* Requirements

    - GTK+ 2.24.x      http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk+/2.24/
    - PyGTK 2.24.x     http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygtk/2.24/
    - Python >= 2.6    http://www.python.org/download/

  Optional

    - zope.interfaces    http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface
    - sqlobject > 0.6.0  http://www.sqlobject.org/

  Some features of the ui test framework requires PyGObject 2.10.0 or higher
  to function properly. It'll work without but some features are disabled.

* Installation

    To install (having made sure that the dependencies are installed and
    working) do (as root normally):

        python setup.py install

    (You can optionally provide a prefix using the following form,
    but if you do remember to setup PYTHONPATH accordingly)

        python setup.py install [--prefix=<prefix>]

    You can also fetch the latest source code from github:

        $ git clone http://github.com/stoq/kiwi.git

* Contribute

    For complete instructions on how to install all dependencies and setting
    up a database so you can test Stoq, look at the wiki:

        http://wiki.stoq.com.br/index.php/Getting_started (English)
        http://wiki.stoq.com.br/index.php/Come%C3%A7ando (Português)

* Documentation

    Included in doc/howto/ and doc/api/ are HTML versions of the
    developer's guide and API reference, respectively. You can also
    browse the online versions at:

        - Developer's guide: http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi/howto/
        - API documentation: http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi/api/

    The developer's guide is available in compressed PostScript format from:

        http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi/howto.ps.gz

    You can regenerate all the documentation; just see doc/Makefile.
    To generate the API docs you will need:

        - epydoc                        http://epydoc.sf.net/

    To generate the developer's guide you will need:

        - Python source (the tarball)   http://www.python.org/download/
        - LaTeX                         (various distributions)
        - latex2html    http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~latex2ht/current/
        - GhostScript                   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
        - NetPBM (for latex2html)       http://netbpm.sf.net/

* Directory Layout

    bin/

        Scripts which are going to be installed

    examples/

        Contains a number of examples, most of which are referenced in
        the documentation.

    kiwi/

        Contains the module code itself; this is installed into your
        Python's site-packages directory by setup.py.

    doc/

        Contains documentation for Kiwi, including the LaTeX source code
        which can be used to rebuild the docs. doc/Makefile contains
        commands to regenerate the full set of docs.

    extra/

        Contains patches to GTK+ and PyGTK code, and helper scripts that
        can be used to accelerate certain tasks.

    glade/

        Glade files used by kiwi itself

    pixmaps/

        Pixmaps, images etc

    po/

        Translations

    tests/

        Contains a number of test cases for the Kiwi widgets and
        framework. All checkins and additions of new code should be
        preceded by a working testcase.

    tools/

        Useful scripts
